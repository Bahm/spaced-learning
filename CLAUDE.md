# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Automation layer

This project is configured for (mostly) hands-off AI development. Key automation:

| Artifact | Location | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| PostToolUse tsc hook | `.claude/settings.json` | Runs `tsc --noEmit` after every file edit; output fed back into Claude's context |
| Pre-commit hook | `.git/hooks/pre-commit` | Blocks commits with type errors or failing unit tests |
| CI workflow | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Runs type-check + unit tests + E2E + build on every push/PR |
| implement-issue skill | `.claude/skills/implement-issue/` | End-to-end TDD workflow: issue → tests → implementation → commit → PR |
| Memory consolidation | `.claude/scripts/post-session.sh` | Run `npm run memory:sync` at session end to extract lessons + ask "what could be more automated?" |

**Intended workflow:**
1. Create a GitHub Issue describing the feature/fix
2. Ask Claude to `/implement-issue <N>` — it reads the issue, writes failing tests, implements, verifies, commits, creates a PR
3. CI verifies the PR automatically
4. Review the diff and merge

## About this project

A PWA flashcard app for Android using the FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) algorithm. Offline-first, no backend, installable via "Add to Home Screen". All code is AI-written. The README expects AI to keep all documentation (including this file) up to date as the project evolves.

## Commands

**CRITICAL**: Node.js is installed via nvm, not the system PATH. Every shell command must source nvm inline — the Bash tool does not persist shell state between invocations.

```bash
# Dev server
bash -c 'export NVM_DIR="${HOME}/.nvm"; source "${NVM_DIR}/nvm.sh"; npm run dev'

# Unit tests (all)
bash -c 'export NVM_DIR="${HOME}/.nvm"; source "${NVM_DIR}/nvm.sh"; npx vitest run tests/unit'

# Unit tests (single file)
bash -c 'export NVM_DIR="${HOME}/.nvm"; source "${NVM_DIR}/nvm.sh"; npx vitest run tests/unit/cards.test.ts'

# E2E tests (auto-starts dev server)
bash -c 'export NVM_DIR="${HOME}/.nvm"; source "${NVM_DIR}/nvm.sh"; npx playwright test'

# Type-check
bash -c 'export NVM_DIR="${HOME}/.nvm"; source "${NVM_DIR}/nvm.sh"; npx tsc --noEmit'

# Production build
bash -c 'export NVM_DIR="${HOME}/.nvm"; source "${NVM_DIR}/nvm.sh"; npm run build'
```

If you see `npm: command not found`, you forgot to source nvm.

## Architecture

The core principle is **separation of pure logic from side effects**:

- `src/domain/` — pure functions only, zero imports from `db/` or `hooks/`. Unit-tested first.
- `src/db/` — Dexie/IndexedDB side effects. Never imported by `domain/`.
- `src/hooks/` — React hooks for **reactive reads** via `useLiveQuery` from `dexie-react-hooks`.
- `src/components/` — thin UI shells. No raw `db.*` calls; repo functions are fine.
- `App.tsx` — tab switcher (Review / Decks / Cards / Add) + deck-review sub-view using a `View` union type. No router library.

**Read path**: hooks use `useLiveQuery` → Dexie re-fires on table mutation → component re-renders.
**Write path**: components call repo functions directly (e.g. `addCard`, `upsertSchedule`, `deleteCard`) — no hook needed for writes.
`useReview` is the exception: it manages the review session state machine and orchestrates both reads (`useLiveQuery` for due cards) and writes (`upsertSchedule` after rating).

## DB schema

Three Dexie tables (current schema version: 3):

```
decks:     id (PK), createdAt
cards:     id (PK), createdAt, deckId
schedules: cardId (PK), due, state, last_review
```

`Card.deckId` is required. `ensureDefaultDeck()` in `deckRepo.ts` is called on app startup (`App.tsx` `useEffect`) to seed a "Default" deck for fresh installs. The v3 Dexie upgrade migration also creates a "Default" deck and backfills `deckId` on all pre-existing cards.

`ScheduleRecord` fields are **snake_case** to match ts-fsrs's own `FSRSCard` type (`elapsed_days`, `scheduled_days`, `learning_steps`, `last_review`). Never use camelCase for these. When adding a new Dexie index, use the exact snake_case field name.

`reviewRepo.ts` owns all conversion between `FSRSCard` (ts-fsrs native, uses `Date` objects) and `ScheduleRecord` (Dexie, stores dates as `.getTime()` numbers). Use `getDueCardsByDeck(deckId)` for deck-scoped review, `getDueCards()` for global review.

## ts-fsrs API quirks

`fsrs.repeat(card, now)` returns `IPreview`, keyed by **numeric** Rating values at runtime but without a numeric index signature in TypeScript. Cast through `unknown`:

```typescript
const next = (result as unknown as Record<number, { card: FSRSCard } | undefined>)[fsrsRating]
```

A direct cast from `IPreview` to `Record<number, ...>` is rejected by TypeScript — the `unknown` intermediate step is required. See `src/domain/scheduler.ts` for the canonical usage.

Rating enum: `Again=1, Hard=2, Good=3, Easy=4` (Manual=0 unused).

## Coding constraints

- Don't define classes except to subclass built-in `Error` (see `CardValidationError` in `cards.ts`). FSRS uses classes internally; our wrappers stay functional.
- Domain functions return new objects — never mutate.
- `useLiveQuery` returns `undefined` on first render; always provide a default (`?? []` or `?? 0`).
- `upsertSchedule` uses `db.schedules.put()` — idempotent.
- Deleting a card also deletes its schedule in a single Dexie transaction. Deleting a deck deletes all its cards and schedules too.
- `useReview(deckId?)` accepts an optional `deckId` — when provided it calls `getDueCardsByDeck`, otherwise `getDueCards`.
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is enabled — array/index access returns `T | undefined`; always null-check.

## Tests

Unit tests cover `src/domain/` only (pure functions). E2E tests cover full user flows in Chromium.

E2E tests clear IndexedDB before each test via `indexedDB.databases()` + `deleteDatabase`, then `page.reload()`. After reload, always `waitForTimeout(200)` before asserting — `ensureDefaultDeck()` runs asynchronously on mount and the deck must exist before any card operation. The Playwright `webServer` config auto-starts the dev server if not already running.

When matching buttons by name, use `exact: true` if the label is a substring of another button's label (e.g. `getByRole('button', { name: 'Add', exact: true })` to avoid matching "Add Deck" too).

`App.tsx` navigation uses a `View` union type — no router:

```typescript
type View =
  | { type: 'tab'; tab: 'review' | 'decks' | 'cards' | 'add' }
  | { type: 'deck-review'; deckId: string; deckName: string }
```

Tab nav is hidden in `deck-review` view; a back arrow navigates to the Decks tab.
